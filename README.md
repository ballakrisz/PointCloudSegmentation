## Project description

The goal of this project is to delve into point cloud segmentation using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). You have to work with the ShapeNet dataset, which contains multiple object categories (from airplanes to wine bottles). By choosing this project, you'll gain expertise in deep learning and spatial data analysis.

## Dataset
The ShapeNetSem dataset will be used, it can be found here: https://shapenet.org/download/shapenetsem
